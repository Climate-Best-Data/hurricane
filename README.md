# Hurricane Preview

This project visualizes hurricane data using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine
- `pip` (Python package installer)

### Setting Up a Virtual Environment

1. **Create a virtual environment**:
   
   Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Run the following command to create a virtual environment named `.venv`:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   
2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

    On macOS and Linux:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
    On Windows:
    ```
    .venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3. **Install the required packages**:

    With the virtual environment activated, install the necessary packages using pip:
    ```
    pip install matplotlib seaborn
    ```

### Running the Script

    With the virtual environment activated, you can run the hurricane_preview.py script:

    ```bash
    python hurricane_preview.py
    ```
    Deactivating the Virtual Environment
    When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by running:

    ```bash
    deactivate
    ```
